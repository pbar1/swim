### Individual Time Search

https://www.usaswimming.org/Home/times/individual-times-search

Searches for list of times by swimmer by first and last name, as well as other 
parameters. If multiple matches are found, the user is presented with a list
including the team, and must pick the proper swimmer. In the past, could be used
to find USA Swimming ID.

### Individual Event Rank

https://www.usaswimming.org/times/individual-event-rank

Simply display the queried swimmer's rank within the other specified parameter.
Not useful for scraping.

### Top Times / Event Rank Search

https://www.usaswimming.org/times/event-rank-search

Returns list of times for a specified event, among other parameters. This is
very useful and can be leveraged to scrape the entire database.

### Power Point Calculator

https://www.usaswimming.org/times/powerpoint-calculator

Calculates the USA Swimming / Hy-Tek Power Point value of a swim based on time.
Not all that useful as it makes a network call that can probably be cached or
derived locally.
